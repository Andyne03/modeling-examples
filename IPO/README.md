# Epic: Innovation Portfolio Optimization Modeling Example

## Motivation
Project Portfolio management is an extremely difficult problem to solve. There are an astronomical number of combinations to select and schedule projects optimally within the scarce and limited resources available.

In addition, there are several conflicting business objectives to be considered when creating a portfolio; consequently, there is a need to optimize the trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. Traditionally, “optimization” of a portfolio is a very manual and time-consuming process, typically producing sub-optimal results that lead to waste and delays in projects and processes.

Project portfolio management requires removing operational inefficiencies to generate savings that can be invested to fuel innovation. Optimizing these investments is not just about cutting costs, but about investing the right amount to deliver value to the business. Project portfolio management requires to frequently determine where to trim, where to invest, and where to shift to innovation. That is, it requires an efficient and repeatable approach to regularly adapt to changes in business requirements and the shifts of the technology landscape.

## Proposed solution
A mathematical optimization application that optimize the selection and scheduling of a portfolio of IT projects such that the trade-offs among various conflicting business objectives  are optimized, while satisfying resource constraints (e.g. labor availability and budgets) and other business constraints (e.g. project precedence constraints).

## Key features of the solution
1. Multi-criteria optimization of the trade-offs among various conflicting  business objectives.
2. Multi-period planning horizon.
3. Project window of opportunity: project release date and project due date.
4. Force-in or force-out a project.
5. Fix or flexible start time of a project.
6. Different categories (investment areas, sponsors, IT organizations, etc.) of projects.
7. Budget constraints (global or by category).
    * Budget adjustments to match cost of forced-in projects.
8. Labor constraints (varying capacity by period).
    * Hiring recommendation to match labor requirements of forced-in projects.
9. Project portfolio shaping to deploy strategy for different project categories.
10. Project precedence constraints.

## Business value
* Automation of number crunching for decision making.
* Data driven decisions.
* User completely drives optimization process.
* Optimal project portfolio aligns company strategy with resources availability and business rules.
* Powerful scenario analysis.
* Optimization of business value.
* Enables frequent re-optimization to constantly adapt to changes of business conditions and shifts of the technology landscape.

## Success stories
A similar tool was used by former HP Global IT to create the FY2015 IT project portfolio. The tool generated 90% of the portfolio benefit with 24% of the portfolio’s cost, while ensuring strategy alignment and execution ability.

The tool was compared with the manual process used at former HP Global IT and it was calculated that the tool constructed a portfolio that drove a $100 million financial benefit to the company versus the portfolio derived by the manual process.

In 2016, the technology was transferred to the former HP-SW Project Portfolio Management R&D team.

## Market potential

* Project portfolio management SW providers such as Planview, ServiceNow, etc. These companies provide SW and services to major IT organizations.
* Major consulting and service providers such as Accenture, Deloitte, KPMG, DXC, etc. These companies need to manage a complex funnel of clients’ project opportunities.
* Fortune 500 global companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Cisco, etc. These companies need to manage a complex funnel of technology innovation opportunities.
* U.S county, state, and federal government organizations need to manage billions of dollars in projects that benefit U.S tax payers.
