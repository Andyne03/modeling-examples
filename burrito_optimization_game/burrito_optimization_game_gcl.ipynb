    "The Burrito Optimization Game is an educational game designed to introduce students to the power of optimization. In the game, the player places burrito trucks on a city map to earn as much profit as possible. In playing the game, the player is essentially solving an optimization problem “by hand”. The game is designed to introduce players to optimization—what it is, what it’s useful for, and why it’s hard to do by hand. To play the game, you must be logged in to your Gurobi account on a desktop."

    "- From **'Demand node data'** we get a list of buildings with customer demand by building.  We are also given the coordinates and building names --- which we find pretty clever.  We use the Gurobi Python [multidict()](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/py_multidict.html) function to initialize one or more dictionaries with a single statement. The function takes a dictionary as its argument. The keys represent the possible combinations of buildings and truck spots.\n",
    "- From **'Demand-Truck data'** we get information about how the demand scales with each building location and truck spot pair.  Customers are only willing to walk so far to a burrito truck, and the actual number of customers you win from a building is smaller the farther away the truck is from the building. If the nearest truck is too far away, you won’t win any customers from that building.  To account for this, there is a demand multiplier based on how far a customer can walk from their building to a truck spot.  The scaled demand below is the product of the demand multiplier and the total customer demand at a building.  We will also extract this data using the Gurobi Python [multidict()](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/current/refman/py_multidict.html) function.  From this, we get the `scaled_demand[b,t]` values.\n",
