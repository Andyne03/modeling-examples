    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A car rental enterprise (which rents only one type of car) has depots in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and Plymouth. We estimate the demand for each day of the week except Sunday (when the enterprise is closed). The following table shows these estimates. We assume that it is not necessary to meet all the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![weeklyDemand](weeklyDemand.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three options to rent a car: one, two, or three days rental. A customer can return the vehicle at the start of the next morning to either the depot from which it was rented or another depot. For example, let’s consider a customer that rents a vehicle for two days on a Thursday, then the vehicle has to be returned on Saturday morning. If a customer rents a vehicle on Friday for three days, the vehicle has to be returned on Tuesday morning. Another example is that the customer rents the vehicle for one day on Saturday. In this case, the vehicle has to be returned on Monday morning;  or if the vehicle is rented for two days, the vehicle has to be returned on Tuesday morning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time period to rent a car is independent of the origin and destination. We know from historical data that the distribution of rental periods is as follows:\n",
    "* 55% of the vehicles are rented for one day,\n",
    "* 20% for two days,\n",
    "* and 25% for three days.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the estimates of percentages of vehicles rented from each depot and returned to a given depot (independent of the day).\n",
    "\n",
    "![FromToPct](FromToPct.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table shows the marginal cost of renting a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Days rented | Marginal cost |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| 1-day | $\\$ 20$ |\n",
    "| 2-day | $\\$ 25$ |\n",
    "| 3-day | $\\$ 30$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘opportunity cost’  of owning a vehicle is $\\$ 15$ per week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Undamaged vehicles can be transferred from one depot to another depot, independently of the distance. A customer cannot rent out a vehicle on the day in which this vehicle is transferred. The following table shows the cost of the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![FromToCst](FromToCst.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "The percentage of returned cars that are damaged is 10%. In this case, the customer needs to pay an extra $100. The damaged vehicle has to be transferred to a repair depot, where it will be repaired the following day. We assume that the cost of transferring a damaged vehicle is the same as transferring an undamaged one. Notice that when the repair depot is the current depot, there is no transfer cost. It takes one day to transfer a damaged vehicle unless it is already at a repair depot. It takes one day to repair a vehicle at the repair depot. There are only two depots with repair capacity. The following table shows the capacity (cars/day) of each repair vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Repair depot | Capacity |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Manchester | 12 |\n",
    "| Birmingham | 20 |\n",
    "\n",
    "A repaired vehicle is available for rent at the depot the next day or may be transferred to another depot (taking a day). For example, a vehicle that is returned damaged on a Tuesday morning is transferred to a repair depot (if not the current depot) on Tuesday, repaired on Wednesday, and is available for rent at the repair depot on Thursday morning. The price to rent a vehicle depends on the number of days for which the car is rented and whether it is returned to the same depot or not. The following table shows the rental prices (in USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "![RentalPrice](RentalPrice.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "We make the following assumptions at the beginning of each day:\n",
    "* Clients return vehicles that are due that day.\n",
    "* Rental enterprise sends damaged vehicles to the repair depot.\n",
    "* Transferred vehicles from other depots arrive.\n",
    "* Rental enterprise sends out transfer vehicles.\n",
    "* Customers rent out vehicles.\n",
    "* Repaired vehicles at a repair depot are available for rental.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the number of vehicles the car rental enterprise should own and where they should be located at the start of each weekday to maximize weekly profit. The enterprise wants a stable solution in which the same expected number of vehicles will be located at the same depot on the same day of subsequent weeks."
