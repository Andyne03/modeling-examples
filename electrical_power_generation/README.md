# Electrical Power Generation

## Objective and Prerequisites

This model is an example of an electrical power generation problem (also known as a unit commitment problem). It selects 
an optimal set of power stations to turn on in order to satisfy anticipated power demand over a 24-hour time horizon.

This model is example 15 from the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, by H. Paul Williams on 
pages 270-271 and 325-326.

This example is of intermediate difficulty; we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that you have 
some knowledge of building mathematical optimization models.
