# Farm Planning

---
### Farm Planning
This model is an example of a multi-period production planning problem. In this case the application is to optimize 
the operation of a farm over 5 years.

More information on this type of model can be found in example #8 of the fifth edition of Model Building in Mathematical Programming, 
by H. Paul Williams on pages 262-263 and 312-315.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and that 
you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or 
constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
