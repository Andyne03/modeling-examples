    "# Innovation Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Innovation Portfolio Optimization is an extremely difficult problem to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, “optimization” of a portfolio is a very manual and time-consuming process, with a lot of room for sub-optimal results leading to waste and delays in projects and processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an astronomical number of combinations to select and schedule projects optimally within the scarce and limited resources available. In addition, there are several conflicting business objectives to be considered when creating a portfolio, consequently there is a need to optimize the trade-offs between these conflicting objectives. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical programming is a declarative approach where the modeler formulates a mathematical optimization problem that captures the key features of a complex decision problem. The Gurobi optimizer solves the mathematical optimization problem using state of the art mathematics and computer science.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical optimization model has five components.\n",
    "* Sets\n",
    "* Parameters\n",
    "* Decision variables\n",
    "* Constraints\n",
    "* Objective function(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this model is to optimize the selection and scheduling of in portfolio from a set of projects $p \\in P$, such that the benefit of the selected projects is optimized while satisfying a pluraity of constraints. Each of this projects is defined by the benefit $v_p$ that the project generates if selected, cost $c_p$ of selecting each project and its duration $d_p$. Additionally each project has a release period $\\lambda_p$ which indicates the earliest period in which a project can start, and a due period $\\delta_p$ which tells the maximum period in which the project can be completed. Extra information is required as input such as the budget $\\beta$ to execute the projects, a penalty value $BigM$ for every unit of extra budget required if needed, a set $T$ of periods in the planning horizon, a set $IN \\subseteq P$ containing the projects that the model will select and a set $OUT \\subseteq P$ containing the projects that will be ignored by the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, the goal is to maximize the benefit, however in this model a parameter $\\alpha$ is used to generate a decreasing function over time, e.g. a dollar in period $t = 1$ has a larger value than a dollar in period $t = 2$. The business constraints to be considered are: Constraint to ensure that a project is selected $y_p = 1$ in case it is included in set $IN$ (\\ref{eq:directSelected}). Constraint (\\ref{eq:directExcluded}) ensures that a project is not selected $y_p = 0$ if the project is part of set $OUT$. A constraint to ensure that a single start period variable $x_{p, t}$ is equal to one in case the project is selected $y_p = 1$ is defined in (\\ref{eq:ifSelectedStart}). In a similar way, constraint (\\ref{eq:ifSelectedFinish}) ensures that a single variable $z_{p, t} = 1$ in case the project is selected $y_p = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints (\\ref{eq:releasePeriod}), (\\ref{eq:duePeriodStart}) and (\\ref{eq:duePeriodCompletion}) are defined to ensure that if project $p$ is selected $y_p = 1$ then it starts $x_{p, t}$ not earlier than period $\\lambda_p$ also that the project is completed at most at $\\delta_p$ period and to link start variables $x_{p, t}$ and $z_{p, t}$ regarding the project duration $d_p$. Constraint (\\ref{eq:budgetConstraint}) checks if the cost of the selected projects does not exceed the total budget $\\beta$, however in case the projects contained in set $IN$ exceeds this budget, the artificial variable $ArtBudget$ takes a positive value to avoid infeasibilities and each unit of extra budget required is penalized by $BigM$ in the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, constraints (\\ref{eq:binaryVariables}) and (\\ref{eq:binaryVariables2}) indicates that selection variables $y_p$, start variables $x_{p, t}$ and completion variables $z_{p, t}$ are binary and constraint (\\ref{eq:continuousVariables}) bounds the artificial variable $ArtBudget$ to be larger or equal to zero.\n",
