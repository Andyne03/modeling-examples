# Marketing Campaign Optimization

## Objective and Prerequisites

This Jupyter Notebook describes a marketing campaign optimization problem that is common in the banking and financial 
services industry. The problem is formulated using the Gurobi Python API and solved using the Gurobi Optimizer. We assume 
that key parameters of the mathematical optimization model of the marketing campaign problem are estimated using machine 
learning predictive response models. The marketing campaign optimization problem entails determining which products to 
offer to each customer in order to maximize total expected profit while satisfying various business constraints

This modeling example is at the beginner level, where we assume that you know Python and that you have some knowledge about 
building mathematical optimization models. 
The reader should also consult the  [documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/?category-filter=documentation)
of the Gurobi Python API.
