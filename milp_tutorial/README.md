# Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tutorial

These models are part of the [Mixed Integer Linear Programming Tutorial](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/chapter-1-why-mixed-integer-programming-mip/).  This video tutorial takes you through the foundationsal principles of Mixed-Integer Linear programming (MILP).  You wil learn why MILP is important, methods for solving a MIP problem, the advantages of using MIP instead of heuristics, and more.
