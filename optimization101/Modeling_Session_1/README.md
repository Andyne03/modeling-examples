# Modeling Session 1

Click to access the [Google Colab modeling1 notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/optimization101/Modeling_Session_1/modeling1_colab.ipynb). You will need to be signed into a Google account to execute the notebook. 
 
If you are able to run Jupyter notebooks on your machine, feel free to download the notebook file with the name that *does not* end in *colab*. Also, the only Python package we use for today other than `gurobipy` is `pandas`, so you may need to install that package. 

## Beware Spoilers!
We also put **completed** versions of the modeling1 notebook in the repo. If you want to work through the notebook without everything filled in make sure not to open that version. 

To get to the completed notebook on Colab, click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/optimization101/Modeling_Session_1/completed_modeling1_colab.ipynb)
