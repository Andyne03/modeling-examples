# Modeling Session 1 - Widget Distribution Optimization

## Problem
Given demand data produced by a hypothetical machine learning model, as well as transportation costs and production capacity, determine the optimal production and shipment of widgets from a set of production facilities to distribution locations that minimizes cost. 

Along with the modeling example, an exercice is provided. It contains some general questions as well as some modeling questions.
